# Phingy

Phingy is a small collection of build scripts which you can mix together differently depending on your project. To use these scripts, you include the required ones in your build script starting with your own project.xml. 

This gives you the build steps which you can view by typing 'phing -l':

  $ phing -l
  build                Build the project
  build:clearcache     Clear cached YAML config
  build:config         Configure build
  build:housekeeping   Delete everything which isn't required for the running of the site. Logs etc
  build:server         Symlink site into sites-enabled AND restart apache
  build:skel           Applies configuration to skel files
  db:create            Create the database including privileges
  db:data:commit       Upload data to S3 from data/db/data.sql
  db:data:dump         Dump DB structure into data/db/data.sql
  db:data:empty        Truncate all tables
  db:data:load         Empty the database and reload from data/db/data.sql
  db:data:update       Download data file from S3 to data/db/data.sql
  db:drop              Drop the database
  db:recreate          Drops and recreates the database
  db:reload            Recreate DB + load data
  db:structure:commit  Upload structure to S3 from data/db/create.sql
  db:structure:dump    Dump DB structure into data/db/create.sql
  db:structure:load    Recreate the DB and load structure from data/db/create.sql
  db:structure:update  Download structure file from S3 to data/db/create.sql
  db:tar:download      Download a tar of the project's data from S3 and untar into data/db/
  db:tar:upload        Create and upload a tar of the project's data to S3
  db:update            Download structure, data from S3 and load
  sphinx:index         Index all Sphinx indexes
  sphinx:symlink       Setup the Sphinx symlink
  typo3:install_tool   Creates the ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL file
  typo3:routes:cache   Cache MCA routes so zend works inside TYPO3.
  typo3:symlink        Generates the required typo3 symlinks

## The namespaces

  build:...     Everything to do with the basic build
  db:...        Database stuff. Creating, loading, uploading, etc.
  typo3:...     or whatever your platform is. All the platform-specific targets.

Other targets might exist such as "sphinx:".

You should name your project targets after your project to avoid any future clashes:

  <target name="myproject:pingpong">
  
  </target>

# The generic README for projects

## Building

A project must be buildable in the following steps:

  git clone [the project] && cd [in the directory]
  phing build
  phing db:update

There must be NO other steps AT ALL otherwise YOU HAVE BROKEN IT. This means all search indexes, permissions, imports and the like must be run at build time and must be aware of whether they're running on development or production and STILL be safe.

## Deployment build tasks

The "build" target will be run on automated deployments so this _must and must only_:

- setup the code so that it is working
- setup all required directories and permissions
- ensure apache config, sphinx config and the like are created (but no symlinking is required)
- _Not_ load any data (as deployment is done to production where the database will exist)
- _Not_ restart any process (since these will be done by the deployment scripts)

This affects the _project.build:before_ and _project.build:after_ targets. It also mandates that all new configuration follows convention rather than configuration (see below).

## Working with data

Use:

  phing db:update

To get the structure or data, use the corresponding target:

  phing db:structure:update
  phing db:data:update

These both work from the files ./data/db/create.sql and ./data/db/data.sql.

## Cleaning away the crap

Logs, temporary files and other junk accumulates on builds. To spring-clean your build run:

  phing build:housekeeping


# Setting up your project

Your project is setup by including a project.xml for your project and then some shared build scripts.

1. Replace your ./build.xml with the contents of ./v1/templates/build.xml
2. Create config/project.xml and copy the contents from ./v1/templates/project.xml
3. Copy over all your project-specific tasks to project.xml. This would be things like: _iopc:do_something_ and _simply:importer_.
4. Add appropriate use of hooks to project.build:config etc, at the bottom of project.xml.
5. Implement project.build:housekeeping.
6. Delete bin/dump_structure and bin/dump_data. You donâ€™t need them anymore.


# About ./build.xml

Build.xml simply includes the other build scripts so you can run them from your project. The first file to be included is project.xml so that it can override all targets in the others, however this is to be avoided lest you want a beating from the build warriors.


A typical order of inclusion is:

    config/project.xml.   Your project tasks go here along with required hooks into the build process.
    platform/typo3.xml.   Tasks to get TYPO3 configured go here. These are generically called "platform" tasks. 
                          The configuration task goes here. See below for discussion.
    database.xml.         Tasks relating to getting the database loaded go here. 
    build.xml.            The overall build script.

You shouldn't have to change this order and should avoid doing so. The order matters: the more specific scripts _must_ come first so they can override the more general. Your build.xml is likely to look like this:

# The configuration task (needConfiguration and build:config)

The configuration task is the step which asks you for all the required info to run the project. This differs mostly with the platform, so you'll find the task in platform/[something].xml. 

For example, the TYPO3 configuration task asks for the TYPO3 version.

If your project needs extra configuration or options, do one of two things:

1. Just use good defaults and don't ask the user (the builder). For example, if you have a shop to link to, put the production URL in there along with "shop.${your build URL}" so it's _convention_ rather than _configuration_.

Or

2. Override the "build:config" target in your project.xml. 

Option 1 is _strongly_ preferred. Option 2 is quick and dirty, but will make your build scripts harder to maintain in future.

As a examples of option 1, suppose you have a shared library and you want to assume that it will be in the shared location. Do this:

    <property name="library_location" value="${share.path}/mylibrary/" />
    <!-- and use it -->
    <target name="exampletask">
        <echo msg="This gives us: ${library_location}" />
    </target>

Or if you have a second domain (e.g. a shop), do this:

    <property name="shop_url" value="shop.${build.url}" />
    <!-- And use it -->
    <target name="exampletask">
        <echo msg="This gives us: ${shop_url}" />
    </target>


# Targets

If you _have_ to override a core target (e.g. "readme" or "build:build") then you create a target of that name in project.xml. The project.xml file overrides all the others because it is included first in your projects build.xml file.

There are a few standard hooks, which are actually just targets in your project.xml file that are called at specific points in the build process.
These are project.build:config and project.build:before and can be found in your project.xml. 

Your projects MUST support these targets otherwise the build will call the target, find it doesn't exist and throw an error. These targets are usually not going to be run directly, so you can hide them from the list of tasks by setting the ' hidden="true"' attribute.

# Versions of phingy

Phingy is installed on the server as a shared library in:

    /share/phingy/v1/

This will be the case for all production code, but you might want to change this. To include from somewhere else just change the line in your build script:

    <property name="phingy.path" value="/var/www/vhosts/phingy/v1/" />

E.g. to

    <property name="phingy.path" value="/home/bobby/code/phingy/v2" />


The phingy sources (i.e. the git project) contain all versions, so you can easily check it out and hack around with the different versions. If you have improvements or fixes, just submit them as pull requests as usual.
